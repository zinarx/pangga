        Merry Christmas Gel! 
        I hope you are feeling well po and 
        I hope you will experience a joyous christmas
        Christmas is being celebrated to remember the 
        birth of Jesus and with that people gather together
        to celebrate it, Rachel Cohn said that "I love snow
        for the same reason I love christmas. It brings people 
        together while time stands still." and at the same time
        people are giving gifts bacause this month is a season of
        giving baya from our hearts. Winston Churchhill said 
        "We make a living by what what we get. We make 
        a life by what we give." But what if you find these two 
        difficult to understand will you let me give you experience?
        If I will give you a gift will you accept me?
        Bitaw kidding aside (pero tinuod bitaw)
        This Christmas is a bit different than before
        kay naa naman ka akong palangga!
        We still have a lokng road to passed by and this Christma 
        I wish you will be brave pa po all the time
        I wish you will be successful in the future
        I wish that all of your dreams will come true
        Basta ha whatever happens nia ra po ako
        If you need someone to cry on bacause the world is too harsh
        I will give you my time po
        I am always available para nimo akong palangga
        Thank you kay gihatagan mo kog space to court you
        It's the best give I've ever recieved
        Amping ka akong palangga!
    
        (malayo man ang ating pagitan sa isa't isa
        ako'y patuloy mo paring napapamangha.
        Tulad ng BUWAN, pinagmamasdan kita at hinahangaan.
        Alam kong maraming mata ang nakatuon sayo aking hirang
        Hindi lang ako ang naantig sa taglay mong katangian
        Sa liwanag mong taglay nakita ko ang tunay na pangarap
        Iyon ang makapiling ka aking hirang.)
